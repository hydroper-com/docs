## 2012

Somewhere in 2012, I, Matheus Dias de Souza, initiated a YouTube channel called *Klaider Klai*¹ demonstrating Android apps and several games.

> **Note**¹: After a personal problem in 2013, the channel was handed to a random person who uploaded no content and changed the channel's name and description.
> All videos were uploaded by me, except the last video on the Grand Fantasia gameplay.

* https://www.youtube.com/KlaiderKlaiAnimekist/videos

I had mutual channels at the time, which were personally deleted by me in the 2022 year:

* Recoyx Anime
* Super Animex Kai

In my mutual channels I used to edit videos frame per frame using the following softwares and assets, between the ending of 2012 until 2014:

* Advanced X Video Converter (AoA media), using free registered mode and video splitting techniques to bypass the trial.
* Windows Movie Maker
* Microsoft Paint and its copy-paste transparency mode
* Assets from the Little Fighter 2 game and its mods made by other persons in the internet such as a guy named **bashcrazy**.

## 2013

After a personal problem in 2013, I handed out the Klaider Klai channel at YouTube and created a new Google account called *Hydroper*, inspired by the Xbox game title Hydro Thunder, a game I was
played for a short time around 2013.

Hydroper had a YouTube channel with miscellaneous contents, however it was personally permanently deleted by me as of the 2022 year.

## 2014

In 2014 I was focused in digital art production. A little earlier than 2014 I was working in three animations:

* Troider (first)
* Plankton X (second)
* Transformice X (third)

Transformice X was on-going a bit in the beginning of 2014, but I lost interest and ended up learning how to use Adobe Photoshop accidentally.

I've learned the following new softwares in 2014:

* Adobe Photoshop
* Adobe Flash Professional
* TechSmith Camtasia Studio

I've drawn several arts during 2014 using Adobe Photoshop and a few were vectorized arts in Adobe Flash Professional.

## 2015

In the ending of 2014, I was learning the following technologies:

* ActionScript 3.0
* MySQL
* PHP
* XAMPP
* Hostinger service for online hosting

In 2015 I built the following projects:

* A forum from the scratch with the technologies (PHP, MySQL, HTML5)
* A highly incomplete map editor (level designer) for the Transformice game

I had done a few experiments with ActionScript 3.0, but they did not go any far.

## 2016

In 2016 I built the following projects:

* Two highly incomplete map editors (level designers) for the Transformice game

## 2017-2024

Between 2017-2024 I was developing the [Hydroper© Jet](https://github.com/hydroper-jet) project, a language influenced by ActionScript 3.0.
I was continuously working at the compiler, but I had restarted the project several times.
