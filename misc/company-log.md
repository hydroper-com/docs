# Company log

## Name log

* Hydroper (ending of 2013)

## 2013

After a personal problem in the ending of 2013, I handed out an old channel at YouTube and created a new Google account called *Hydroper*, inspired by the Xbox game title Hydro Thunder, a game I played for a short time around 2013.

Hydroper had a YouTube channel with miscellaneous contents, however it was personally permanently deleted by me as of the 2022 year.

## 2015

In the ending of 2014, I was learning the following technologies:

* ActionScript 3.0
* MySQL
* PHP
* XAMPP
* Construct 2
* Hostinger service for online hosting
* UOL XPG online hosting

In 2015, I've changed my internet name to *Hand on Cloud* and I've built the following projects:

* A forum from the scratch with the technologies (PHP, MySQL, HTML5)
* A highly incomplete map editor (level designer) for the Transformice game

I had done a few experiments with ActionScript 3.0, but they did not go any far.

## 2017-2024

Between 2017-2024 I was developing the [Hydroper Jet](https://github.com/hydroper-jet) project, a language influenced by ActionScript 3.0.
I was continuously working at the compiler, but I had restarted the project several times. The Jet project is inactive.
In 2023 the single person company got back to being called Hydroper. It was sometimes returning to being called either Klaider Animekist or something else.

## Life decision

I am Hydroper.
